# Routes

### Simple Routes

Create a file/folder inside the the routes folder. Name of file will become the name of route path.

If folder => name the file => index.tsx

### Loading Data

In Remix your frontend component is also its own API route and it already knows how to talk to itself on the server from the browser. That is, you don't have to fetch it.

Your routes are their own controller.

useLoaderData : This hook returns the JSON parsed data from your route loader function.

```
import { Link, useLoaderData } from "@remix-run/react";

//  This function requires to be the name loader.
export const loader = async () => {
  const posts = [
    {
      slug: "my-first-title",
      title: "my-first-post",
    },
    {
      slug: "trail-riding-with-one-wheel",
      title: "Trail Riding with one wheel",
    },
  ];
  const postsString = JSON.stringify({ posts });
  // We are passing the posts inside an object b.c after stringify , it will become json
  // The Response interface of the Fetch API represents the response object to a request.
  // 1st parameter is the Response body in json format and 2nd parameter is the response header object
  return new Response(postsString, {
    headers: {
      "Content-Type": "application/json",
    },
  });
};

const Posts = () => {
  const { posts } = useLoaderData();
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Posts</h1>
      <ul>
        {posts.map((post: { slug: string; title: string }) => (
          <li key={post.slug}>
            <Link to={post.slug}>{post.title}</Link>
          </li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
};

export default Posts;

```

Creating a new Response object and then stringifying the data to send it to the client is a pain.
That's why json from @remix-run/node has a json function which does all of this for us.

```
import { Link, useLoaderData } from "@remix-run/react";
import { json } from "@remix-run/node";

//  This function requires to be the name loader.
export const loader = async () => {
  const posts = [
    {
      slug: "my-first-title",
      title: "my-first-post",
    },
    {
      slug: "trail-riding-with-one-wheel",
      title: "Trail Riding with one wheel",
    },
  ];
  return json({ posts });
  // We can also pass headers as 2nd parameter to json function but it does it automatically.
  // For custom content type , we have the option
};

const Posts = () => {
  const { posts } = useLoaderData();
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Posts</h1>
      <ul>
        {posts.map((post: { slug: string; title: string }) => (
          <li key={post.slug}>
            <Link to={post.slug}>{post.title}</Link>
          </li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
};

export default Posts;
```
