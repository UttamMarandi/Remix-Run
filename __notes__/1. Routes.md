# Routes

### Simple Routes

Create a file/folder inside the the routes folder. Name of file will become the name of route path.

If folder => name the file => index.tsx

### Loading Data

In Remix your frontend component is also its own API route and it already knows how to talk to itself on the server from the browser. That is, you don't have to fetch it.

Your routes are their own controller.

useLoaderData : This hook returns the JSON parsed data from your route loader function.

```
import { Link, useLoaderData } from "@remix-run/react";

export const loader = async () => {
  const posts = [
    {
      slug: "my-first-title",
      title: "my-first-post",
    },
    {
      slug: "trail-riding-with-one-wheel",
      title: "Trail Riding with one wheel",
    },
  ];
  const postsString = JSON.stringify({ posts });
  return new Response(postsString, {
    headers: {
      "Content-Type": "application/json",
    },
  });
};

const Posts = () => {
  const { posts } = useLoaderData();
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Posts</h1>
      <ul>
        {posts.map((post: { slug: string; title: string }) => (
          <li key={post.slug}>
            <Link to={post.slug}>{post.title}</Link>
          </li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
};

export default Posts;
```
